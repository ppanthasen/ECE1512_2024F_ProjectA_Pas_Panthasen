Some parts of the code and datasets in this project are adapted from the following sources:

1. **[DataDAM Repository](https://github.com/DataDistillation/DataDAM)**  
   The method and some code related to Dataset Distillation and Attention Matching are adapted from the DataDAM repository. The techniques proposed in this repository were used in this project for dataset distillation and model evaluation.

2. **[PAD Repository](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/PAD)**  
   The Prioritize Alignment in Dataset Distillation (PAD) method and its implementation are adapted from the PAD repository. This method was integrated into the project to improve dataset distillation performance.
